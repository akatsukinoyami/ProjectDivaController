儘管這在Android上也能運作，不過安卓用戶建議選擇[ProjectDivaControllerServer][1] + [ProjectDivaControllerClient][2]的組合，具有更好的效能。本專案移植於此，並且在移植過程中不可避免的少了一點功能。  
Although this also works on Android, Android users are advised to choose the combination of [ProjectDivaControllerServer][1] + [ProjectDivaControllerClient][2] ,which has slightly better performance. This project is ported from this, and inevitably some features are missing during the porting process.

調整滑動專用區域的參數在WebClient/client.html裡的`const slider_height = 25;`  
The parameters for adjusting the dedicated slider area are located in WebClient/client.html: `const slider_height = 25;`

對於IOS用戶，可能會需要退出全螢幕模式。至於理由當你碰到後就知道了。  
For iOS users, you may need to exit full-screen mode. You'll find out why once you encounter it. "It looks like you are typing while in full screen"

There are known issues with WebSocket in Safari/iOS 26. iOS users may need to try using different browsers.
